    ### Intro
    I am a long time Eve player with software engineering background. I mainly play PVE content such as abbysal and escalation.
    I also enjoy Faction Warfare content. However I am Alpha player so my gameplay is limited to the skill i have access to. With that being say,
    I personally enjoyed 1v1 small ship PVP. I decided to make these data out of curiosity and to hone my coding skill. Hopefully it is useful for some of you.
    
    ### Source Code
    The source code for the streamlit app and script I used to retrieve data are available on my github rep
    I must warn you though, the code is really messy and a lot of the task is done manually.
